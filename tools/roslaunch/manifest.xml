  <description brief="ROS Process Launcher">

roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Nodes">nodes</a> locally and remotely via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Parameter Server">Parameter Server</a>. It includes options to automatically respawn processes that have already died. roslaunch takes in one or more XML configuration files (with the <tt>.launch</tt> extension) that specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the machines that they should be run on.
